# Stakeholder Memo


**To:** CitiBike Operations Manager  
**Subject:** Forecasting Daily Bike Demand to Improve Rebalancing 

---

### Problem
CitiBike customers often encounter empty docks at busy stations and unused bikes at others. This mismatch frustrates riders and reduces overall system efficiency. The main challenge is anticipating demand at each station before the day begins.  

### Proposed Approach
I will use historical trip data (published monthly by CitiBike) combined with weather forecasts to build a predictive model of daily demand per station. The output will be the *ideal number of bikes to place at each station before the morning rush*.  

### Value to Operations
- **Reduce shortages:** Ensure high-demand stations start the day with enough bikes.  
- **Reduce surpluses:** Avoid excess idle bikes at less busy locations.  

### Next Steps
- Collect and clean CitiBike trip data and weather forecasts.  
- Train and validate a forecasting model.  
- Produce a daily table of bike requirements per station.
